# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

<div align="justify">
I'm a software engineering student and a full-stack developer. I like to build minimalist, creative and functional digital services/applications. I'm a Typescript and Deno entusiast, also I can easliy work in every stack of the development, no matter the phase, from the planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with functional and scalable code.
